# Madhu's Python Bootcamp Journey 🐍

📚 This repository contains my hands-on practice files from a Data Analytics Bootcamp where I’m learning Python step by step—one concept, one notebook at a time.

## 📁 What's Inside

- `Day3work.ipynb` – Practiced loops, conditionals, and basic function writing  
- `Day4work.ipynb` – Focused on Python data structures: lists, dictionaries, and sets  
- `Day5work.ipynb` – Combined concepts to build a basic task tracker using functions and I/O  

## 🧠 What I'm Learning

- Python fundamentals: variables, data types, control flow  
- Custom functions and loop logic  
- Working with collections like lists and dictionaries  
- Basic input/output handling and debugging  
- Clean, reusable code through mini-projects  

## 🚀 Why This Matters

This journey is more than code—it's about building patience, problem-solving skills, and confidence as a future data analyst.

## 🙌 Thanks To
